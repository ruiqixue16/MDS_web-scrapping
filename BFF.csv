Dennis Cail,"Growing up humble in Louisiana, Dennis Cail lived in low-income public housing and neighborhoods often surrounded by payday lenders and check cashing services; the same was true of the areas surrounding the naval bases he lived on after joining the navy. These experiences coupled with his passion to close the wealth gap across underserved and overlooked communities led him to create Zirtue as an economic inclusion hack for unbanked and underbanked people that provided them with access to fair and equitable trust-based loans. Zirtue was built on one simple premise, to give people a hand-up and not a hand-out from the people who know them best.",Zirtue
